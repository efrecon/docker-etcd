# Note that etcd catches all variables that start with ETCD_ and possibly
# understands them as command-line arguments.  So we use a variable that does
# NOT start directly with ETCD to contain the version.

# The following enables fetching of the latest version of etcd solely based on
# the version numbered declared above.  This is why we require alpine and not
# busybox, as we need curl to fetch the latest binaries (wget, which is included
# in busybox, does not support https links!)
